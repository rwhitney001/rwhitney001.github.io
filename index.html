    <h1> <strong>Ryan Whitney</strong></h1>
    <p>My name is Ryan Whitney. This is my first year attending <a href="http://www.osu.edu">The Ohio State University.</a> I am majoring in computer science and engineering. <br />
    I have one brother, and his name is Zach. Zach is in sixth grade. I attended Hilliard Davidson for high school. In high school I<br />
    ran cross country and track. Running was very important to me, and I ran year round. I now enjoy running causally with my friends.  </p>
    <p>Here is a list of foods I like:</p>
     <ol>
        <li>Peanut Butter and Jelly</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Waffles</li>
    </ol>
